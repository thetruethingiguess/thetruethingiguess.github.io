  <p>There are 26 letters in the Latin alphabet and 33 letters in the Cyrillic alphabet. Alphabets are used to make words and sentences with each letter getting a sound. But there is always some letters that are removed from alphabets (ѵ, ƿ); this site is dedicated to one of them in Latin.</p>

  <p>English people didn't have a letter to represent the /th/ and /w/ sound previously, but in the 800's that all changed. People who speak in runes have similar phonemes to Old English, so they used ᚦ and ᚹ, called þurisaz and ƿunjō;  þat's the reason of the creation for þe letter Þ.</p>
  
  <p>Þ is formerly a letter in the English alphabet, making the 'th' sound in oTHer and THing. Þis letter is so awesome since þe þing about Þ is þat it is removed from the alphabet due to þe printing press, and for looking like the letter Y. Þat's why in some places "Ye Olde" is used, but it is actually "The Olde".</p>

  <p>So eventually we got so used to the "y" and "th" þat we forgot about þe letter Þ. :((</p>
  
  <p>Except not really. We are in a new millenium with computers & wiþ unicode, and also; Icelandic, a nordic language still uses þ? Why do we still use ":p" when we can use ":þ"? </p>

  <p>So I decided to make a site dedicated to Þ. I discovered Þ when I stumbled a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUrDUxh5xS0">"10 letters we dropped from the alphabet"</a> and I was like "Wow, þat's cool!", even I was like "But how do we use þ?" and I stumbled across another video þat is just called "þ". And þat's easy!. I was like "þat".</p>
